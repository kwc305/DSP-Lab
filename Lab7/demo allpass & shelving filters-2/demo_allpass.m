%% All-pass system transfer function
% H(z) = B(z)/A(z)
% is allpass if coefficients of B(z) are 
% the reverse-ordered coefficients of A(z)

% This is a first-order allpass system

a = [5 -4]
%a = wavread('author.wav')
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);

% See that |H(om)| = 1

% The phase response (radians/pi)

clf
plot(om, angle(H)/pi)

% See that at om = pi, angle(H) = -pi.
% That makes sense because H(-1) must be a real number.
% Since H is allpass, H(-1) must be 1 or -1.
% Here H(-1) = -1 since angle(H) = -pi.

%% Pole-zero plot
% The zeros are the reciprocals of the poles

zplane(b,a)

roots(b)
roots(a)
% reciprocals!

%% 2nd-order all-pass

a = [5 -4 3]
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);

plot(om, abs(H))  % Verify that |H(om)| = 1

%%
% A jump in the phase by 2pi is not a true discontinuity

plot(om, angle(H)/pi) 

%%
% Remove jumps by 2pi using the 'unwrap' function.
% (Unwrap the phase)

plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi)

% Notice now that at om = pi the angle is -2pi, 
% so H(-1) = 1.
% Also note that the angle is -pi at some frequency
% between 0 and pi. So H(-1) = -1 at that frequency.
% At that frequency, an input sine wave will be negated.

% pole-zero diagram - complex poles and zeros. 
% Observe reciprocal property (zeros are the reciprocals
% of the poles)

%% Order-3 all-pass system

a = [5 -4 3 -2]
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
plot(om, abs(H))   % Observe |H(om)| = 1

%%

plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi)
% Notice now that at om = pi the angle is -3pi, 
% therefore H(-1) = -1.
% Also note that the angle is -pi and -2pi at two frequencies
% between 0 and pi. So H(-1) = -1 and H(-1) = 1 at those frequency.

% Note that the phase is monotonically decreasing!

%% Order-4 all-pass system

a = [5 -4 3 -2 1]
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi)

% Notice now that at om = pi the angle is -4pi, 
% therefore H(-1) = 1.
% Since the phase is monotonically decreasing, 
% It passes through -pi, -2pi, -3pi at three
% frequencies between om = 0 and om = pi.

%% All-pass + Direct path
% Consider a system composed of an all-pass system
% and a direct path (in parrallel).
% The total transfer function is
% G(z) = H(z) + 1 = B(z)/A(z) + 1
% where B(z)/A(z) is the all-pass system.
% What does the freuqency response H look like and why?

Id = ones(size(H));   % Frequency response of direct path

% Order-1 example
a = [5 -4]
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);

plot(om, abs( Id + H ) );
% The frequency response is a low-pass filter
% with a null at om = pi.
% That can be predicted since the all-pass filter
% is -1 at om = pi. They add to zero.

%% Order-2 example

a = [5 -4 3]
b = flip(a)
[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
plot(om, ( Id+H ) );
% Now the total system is a notch filter with a null.
% Where is the null?
% It is at the frequency where the all-pass filter is -1.
% At om = pi, the frequency response of the total system
% is 2 because the all-pass system is 1 at that frequency
% so it adds to the direct path.

%%

plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi, om, abs(Id + H))
grid
% Note that the null in the frequency response is
% at the frequency where the phase of the all-pass
% system is -pi.

%% Order-3 example

a = [5 -4 3 -2]
b = flip(a)
[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
plot(om, abs( Id + H ) );
% Now the frequency response of the total system
% has a null and a gain of 2 at two different frequencies.
% It also has a null at om = pi. What are these frequencies?

%%
plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi, om, abs(Id + H))
grid
% The two nulls are where the phase of the all-pass
% system are equal to -pi and -3pi (ODD multiplies of pi).
% At those frequencies the all-pass filter is -1 
% so it cancels the direct path.
% The point where the total frequency response has a gain of 1
% is where the phase of the all-pass filter is -2pi (EVEN multiples
% of pi). At these frequencies, the all-pass system is +1
% so it adds to the direct path. 


%% Order-4 example

a = [5 -4 3 -2 1]
b = flip(a)

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi, om, abs(Id + H))
grid
% There are two nulls; they are where the all-pass
% system is -1, which is where the phase of the all-pass
% system is an ODD multiple of pi. 
% Where the phase of the all-pass system is an EVEN
% mulitple of pi, the all-pass frequency response is +1,
% so it ADDS to the direct path, and the total gain is 2.

%% Delay + all-pass system.
% A delay is a special case of an all-pass system.
% If the all-pass system is a delay, i.e.,
% H(z) = B(z)/A(z) = z^(-10), 
% then what do you get when you put it in parallel with a direct path?
% Lets see the frequency response of G(z) = H(z) + 1 = z^(-10) + 1

H = exp( - 1j * 10 * om);  % frequency response of delay system
plot(om, unwrap(angle(H))/pi, om, abs(Id + H))

% The frequency response has equally space nulls. Why?
% Because the phase of the delay is a straight line -- it pass through
% ODD multipleis of pi at equally spaced points.

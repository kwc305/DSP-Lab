# playAM_blocking_fix.py
# Play a mono wave file with amplitude modulation. 
# This implementation reads and plays a block at a time (blocking)
# and corrects for block-to-block angle mismatch.
# Assignment: modify file so it works for both mono and stereo wave files
#  (where does this file have an error when wave file is stereo and why? )
